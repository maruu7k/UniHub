        <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">Be sure to keep the photocopies in a location that is separate from the original documents; doing so will make it much simpler for you to obtain a new passport and visa from the embassy in the case that the originals are misplaced or stolen.

        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Medications obtainable only with a doctor's prescription </h2>
        <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">If you take any medications that require a prescription, it is a good idea to make sure that you have enough medication to last the entire time that you are away from home. It is quite likely that a foreign pharmacy will not honor your home country's prescription; therefore, it is best to bring a duplicate of the prescription with you so that you can show it to a local physician in the event that you require further medication.

Deodorant, toothpaste, a toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are the types of toiletries that we consider to be absolute necessities, and you should be sure to pack them in your carry-on bag

        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Adapters and Converters for Electrical Current</h2>
        <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">It's probable that you'll want to carry a few chargers with you on your trip, whether they're for your smartphone or your laptop. In order to do so, you'll need a converter, and you may also need an adapter. Not all nations use the same electricity voltage, which means that merely altering the style of the plug might not be enough to make your charger operate – it could even be unsafe and short out the gadget. Be sure to research the types of plugs and voltage that are utilised in the country to which you will be travelling so that you can bring the appropriate adapters for all of your electronic equipment.

        <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">Standards of modesty and the appropriateness of casual attire will differ from place to place, to an extent that is heavily influenced by the institution at which you are enrolled in your academic program.
          Keep in mind that shoes take up a lot of room. You will require three sets of shoes: a pair of flip-flops to use in the shower, a pair of comfortable walking shoes that are not running shoes, and a pair of dressier shoes to wear while going out or having dinner. Do your best to resist the temptation to bring any more pairs than that.
